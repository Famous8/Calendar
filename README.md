# Why is this Calendar different?
- Privacy is our first priority. For now, your data is stored locally on your own device, nowhere else.
- We will have many different views to choose from that look modern, and minimal, compared to others
- We have multiple features that will be helpful for Muslims. Such as, Islamic Dates, Islamic Events, and Salaat Times.
- This Calendar is open source, and you can contribute ideas and functions to it too!

# Get the Calendar soon on the Google Play Store!
